  Arctic: "Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. Some life signs and vegetation, most of it clustered around the slightly warmer equatorial regions."
  Arid: "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce. Moderate life signs detected."
  Continental: "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Ladnmasses are separated by vast oceans, with large climate variations depending on temperature and precipitation. Significant biosphere."
  Desert: "Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation and major bodies of surface water are relatively rare. Significant temperature variations between day and night cycles. Scarce vegetation with moderate life signs."
  Ocean: "Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than 95% of the surface, with scattered Islands making up the remaining percentage. Abundant life signs, the vast majority aquatic."
  Tropical: "Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate regions by the equator. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to masses and lichens."
  Tundra: "Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate regions by the equator. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to masses and lichens."
