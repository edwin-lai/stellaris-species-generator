  `Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen
  atmosphere. Active and stable
  hydrosphere. Landmasses are separated
  by vast oceans, with large climate
  variations depending on temperature and
  precipitation. Significant biosphere.`,

  name: "Ocean",
  description:
  `Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen
  atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere.
  Oceans cover more than 95% of the
  surface, with scattered Islands making up
  the remaining percentage. Abundant life
  signs, the vast majority aquatic.`,

`Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen
atmosphere. Significant water deposits can
be found permanently frozen as glacial ice.
Some life signs and vegetation, most of it
clustered around the slightly warmer
equatorial regions.`,

  description:
  `Cold and rocky world with a
  nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost
  covers most of the surface except for the
  more temperate regions by the equator. A
  stable biosphere exists but vegetation is
  mostly limited to masses and lichens.`,

PlanetInfo.ARID= {
name: "Arid",
description:
`Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen
atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain
consists largely of mesas and canyons.
Forests can be found in the more temperate
polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise
scarce. Moderate life signs detected.`,

PlanetInfo.DESERT = {
name: "Desert",
description:

of surface water are relatively rare.
Significant temperature variations between
day and night cycles. Scarce vegetation
with moderate life signs.`,

PlanetInfo.TROPICAL = {
name: "Tropical",
description:
`Humid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen
atmosphere. Seasons with significant
precipitation are interchanged with drier
periods. Most landmasses are covered in
dense vegetation and there are abundant
life signs.`,
